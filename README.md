## Project Details
This was a project (assignment) for a Macquarie University unit. I had to make a PHP eCommerce site totally from scratch.
It has all basic functionality like Registration, Registration confirmation, Login, Browse, Order, Shopping cart management, Checkout, Logoff etc.

It does both client side and server side validation. JavaScript and PHP have been used. For the database, MySQL has been used.
